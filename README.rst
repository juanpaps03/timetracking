Basic Commands
--------------

Setting Up Your Users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* To create a **normal user account**, just go to Sign Up and fill out the form. Once you submit it, you'll see a "Verify Your E-mail Address" page. Go to your console to see a simulated email verification message. Copy the link into your browser. Now the user's email should be verified and ready to go.

* To create an **superuser account**, use this command::

    $ python manage.py createsuperuser

For convenience, you can keep your normal user logged in on Chrome and your superuser logged in on Firefox (or similar), so that you can see how the site behaves for both kinds of users.

Test coverage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run the tests, check your test coverage, and generate an HTML coverage report::

    $ coverage run manage.py test
    $ coverage html
    $ open htmlcov/index.html

Running tests with py.test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  $ py.test

Mass Data Entry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For mass data entry from a CSV file, place the filename.csv file at the same level of manage.py.

Then, from the Django shell:

    >>> from tracker.helpers import *
    >>> add_worker_categories('filename.csv')

add_worker_categories can be substituted for add_task_categories, add_workers or add_tasks accordingly.

Format for worker and task categories is just the names, one per line.

For workers: code, first name, last name, category name

For tasks: code, name, description, category name, requires_comment, is_boolean, whole_day, in_monthly_report.

Remember to use capitalized boolean values (TRUE, FALSE).
